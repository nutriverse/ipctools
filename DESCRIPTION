Description: The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) is a widely 
    used tool for classifying and analyzing the severity and magnitude of food 
    insecurity and malnutrition situations in various countries and regions 
    around the world. It provides a common understanding of the food security 
    situation and enables decision-makers to take appropriate actions to 
    mitigate and respond to food crises. This package provides functions and
    utilities that support IPC-related data analysis and visualisation.
